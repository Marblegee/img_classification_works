This paper delves into image classification, a pivotal area in computer vision, through supervised learning techniques using predefined category labels. Leveraging Artificial Neural Networks, particularly architectures like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Residual Network (ResNet), and VGG16, significant advancements have been made since the early 2010s. The study employs popular datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and Places. We introduce a basic CNN model and its deeper variant, and explore dual implementations of ResNet50 and VGG16, both in their original form and pre-trained on the Imagenette dataset, a subset of ImageNet. The results highlight the importance of model depth, skip connections, and the benefits of transfer learning. Overall, the research underscores the need for choosing architectures based on dataset and task specificities, reflecting on the complexities and advance
